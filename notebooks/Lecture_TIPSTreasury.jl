### International Inflation-Linked Bond Puzzle
> - _Italian bond markets, for example, exhibited unprecedented price discrepancies between different classes of bond issued by the government as a result of the ECB’s LTRO liquidity injection._\
> - _In January, investors dumped inflation-protected Italian bonds, fearful that they would automatically drop out of key European bond indices if the country’s credit rating was downgraded, while at the same time Italian banks snapped up regular Italian bonds with LTRO cash._\
> - **_Hedge funds bought the cheap inflation-protected bonds, wrote swaps to offset inflation and then shorted expensive regular Italian bonds, thereby completely hedging out credit risk and inflation and locking in the supply and demand-driven difference between the two bonds._**\
> - _The spread between them was more than 200 basis points, according to Bob Treue, the founder of Barnegat, a US-based fixed income arbitrage hedge fund that has made 18 per cent on its investments so far this year._

### Treasury Bill (T-Bill)
- Short-term securities with maturities of 4, 13, 26, and 52 weeks.
- Treasury bills do not pay interest before maturity.
  - This is often referred to as a _discount security_ or _zero-coupon security_.
- Instead, Treasury bills are issued at a price less than their par value and at maturity, Treasury bills pay back their par value.
  - Intuitively, the “interest” to the investor is the difference between par value and the purchase price.
  - Example: a 52-week T-bill with par value of \$100 has a price of \$98.

### Treasury STRIPS

- The Treasury does not issue zero-coupon notes or bonds.
- However, because of the demand for zero-coupon instruments with no credit risk, the private sector has created such securities.
- The process of separating the interest on a bond from the underlying principal is called coupon stripping
- Zero-coupon Treasury securities were first created in August 1982 by large Wall-Street firms.
  - The problem with these securities was that they were identified with particular dealers and therefore reduced liquidity.
  - Moreover, the process involved legal and insurance costs. 
  - Today, all Treasury notes and bonds (fixed-principal and inflation-indexed) are eligible for stripping. 
- The **zero-coupon** Treasury securities created under the STRIPS program are direct obligations of the U.S. government

  - An index-linked bond is one whose _cash flows_ are linked to movements in a specific price index.
- The _principal amount_ of a TIPS is indexed to the price level. 
  - Since a fixed coupon rate is applied to the principal that varies with the price level, the actual coupon cash flows vary in response to the realized rate of inflation.

### Inflation Adjustment

- A simple example is useful at this stage to clarify the concepts. 
- Suppose that an investor is faced with the choice between two instruments with the same maturity: 
  - Conventional bond yielding a _nominal_ yield of 5% 
  - Index-linked bond offering a _real_ yield of 3%. 
- The market’s valuations of these two bonds would imply that inflation is expected to be of the order of 2% per annum over their lifetime (5% - 3%=2%). 
- If the rate of inflation actually turns out to be higher at, say, 4% on average, then at maturity the indexed bond will have generated a 3% real return (precisely as expected). 
- The conventional bond’s 5% nominal return will have been eroded such that its ex post real yield is only 1%. 
- Of course, the reverse could occur instead. 
  - Suppose inflation turns out to be lower on average than had been expected at, say, 1%, then the conventional bond’s real return would turn out to be 4%, while that on the indexed bond would still have been 3%.

#### TIPS Inflation Adjustment Details

- The principal amount of a TIPS (assume $100 at issuance) is adjusted daily based on the CPI-U. 
- The inflation adjustment $I_t$ is computed as the ratio of the **Reference CPI** at the time $t$ divided by the reference CPI when the TIPS was first issued ($t=0$). 
$$I_t = \frac{\textrm{Reference CPI at time } t}{\textrm{Reference CPI at TIPS issue date}}$$

- The **Reference CPI** for a particular date $t$ during a month is linearly interpolated from the **Reference CPI** for the beginning of that month and the **Reference CPI** for the beginning of the subsequent month.
  - The **Reference CPI** for the first day of _any_ calendar month is the CPI-U index for the third preceding calendar month. 
  - _Example 1_: the **Reference CPI** for _April 1_ is the CPI-U index for the month of _January_ (which is reported by the BLS during February).
  - _Example 2_: the **Reference CPI** for _April 15_ is roughly the average of the CPI-U index for the month of _January_ and the CPI-U index for the month of February.
- However, the dollar value of the TIPS principal value is bounded below at $100, its value at issuance. Hence, TIPS offer some deflation protection.

#### Reference CPI Caluclation Example for January 25, 1997
- To find the **Reference CPI** for any date in Janurary 1997, we first find the **Reference CPI** index levels for January 1, 1997 and for February 1, 1997.
  - The **Reference CPI** level is the US CPI-U index from three months prior.
  - For January this is the CPI-U from October 1996 (published by the BLS in November) and for February this is the CPI-U from November 1996 (published by the BLS in December).
- Then, take the difference between the two index CPI-U index levels and divide by it by the actual number of days in the month.  
- Next, multiply the result by the number of the day for which the **Reference CPI** is to be calculated and subtract 1.
  - For example, January 7 would be 6. January 25 is 24.
- Finally, add this result to the January 1st, CPI-U index level.

### Combining TIPS and Inflation Swap

- Suppose we invest in a TIPS with 6 months to maturity, coupon rate of 4%, and  (inflation-adjusted) principal of $100 .
- Thus, we receive one final cash flow consisting of
  - Inflation-adjusted principal: $$100\times I_{0.5}$$  
    - For simplicity, we ignore the deflation option for now.
  - Inflation-adjusted coupon cash flow: $(c/2) \times I_{0.5} \times 100 = 0.02 \times I_{0.5} \times 100$
- The total cash flow from the TIPS is:
$$102 \times I_{0.5} = 102$$
- Next, suppose we enter into an inflation swap with notional amount of $102 as inflation seller. Let the fixed rate on the inflation swap be 0.9828%, i.e. $$f=0.009828$$.
- The net cash flow on the inflation swap is
$$102 \times [(1+f)^{0.5}-1] - 102 \times [I_{0.5}-1]$$
- The total cash flow of the TIPS and the inflation swap is:
$$102 \times I_{0.5} + \left(102 \times [(1+f)^{0.5}-1] - 102 \times [I_{0.5}-1] \right)$$
- Simplifying
$$102 \times (1+f)^{0.5} = 102 \times (1+0.9828\%)^{0.5} = 102.50$$
- This is a deterministic cash flow that does not depend on future inflation.
- Suppose the market price of the TIPS is 100, and that the market price of a Treasury note with six months to maturity and coupon rate of 5% is 102.
- Next, we take a short position in the Treasury note and buy the TIPS. 
- We pay $100 for the TIPS and get $102 in cash from shorting the Treasury notes.
- Our net cash flow is 102 - 100 = 2.
- What is our obligation to pay in six months?
- First, we need to close out the short in the Treasury note and pay $102.50. Thus, we have a cash outflow of -102.50.
- Second, we have a cash flow from the long TIPS position and the inflation swap of $102.5. This is a cash inflow of 102.50.
- Our net cash flow is -102.5 + 102.5 = 0. Thus, we have zero cash flow in six months.
- However, we pocketed $2 upfront. 
- This is an arbitrage since we collect $2 now and have no future obligation in six months.
- This is the TIPS-Treasury arbitrage trading strategy in simplified form.

- Simplifying
$$102 \times (1+f)^{0.5} = 102 \times (1+0.9828\%)^{0.5} = 102.50$$
- This is a deterministic cash flow that does not depend on future inflation.
- Suppose the market price of the TIPS is 100, and that the market price of a Treasury note with six months to maturity and coupon rate of 6% is 102.
- Next, we take a short position in the Treasury note and buy the TIPS. 
- We pay $100 for the TIPS and get $102 in cash from shorting the Treasury notes.
- Our net cash flow is 102 - 100 = 2.
- What is our obligation to pay in six months?
- First, we need to close out the short in the Treasury note and pay $103. Thus, we have a cash outflow of -103.00.
- Second, we have a cash flow from the long TIPS position and the inflation swap of $102.5. This is a cash inflow of 102.50.
- Our net cash flow is -103 + 102.5 = -0.50. 
- Thus, we have non-zero cash outflow of fifty cents in six months.
- We want to have zero cash flows in six months. How can we achive this?
- Recall that there are STRIPS which are zero coupon bonds with just one cash flow at maturity.
- All we need is an inflow of fifty cents from a 6-month STRIPS.
- Suppose the price of a 6-month Treasury STRIPS is 99.50 (per 100 par value). The STRIPS will give us a cash inflow of 100 in 6 months.
- Since we need \$0.50, we buy \$0.50 par value of this STRIPS.
- This costs us 0.50/100 * 99.50 = $0.4975.
- Thus, our cash flow today is now the cash inflow of 2 (from the long TIPS and short Treasury note) and the cash outflow of 0.4975 from the STRIPS.
- This is a net cash flow today of 2 - 0.4975 = 1.5025.
- We now have zero cash flow in six months and a positive cash flow of 1.5025 today.
- This is an arbitrage since we collect $1.5025 now and have no future obligation in six months.

- The table shows the actual cash flows that would result from applying the arbitrage strategy on December 30, 2008, to replicate the 7.625% coupon Treasury bond maturing on February 15, 2025. 
- As shown, the price of the Treasury bond is **$169.479.** 
- To replicate the Treasury bond’s cash flows, the arbitrageur buys a 2.375% coupon TIPS issue with the same maturity date for a price of $101.225. 
- Since there are 33 semiannual coupon payment dates, 33 inflation swaps are executed with the indicated notional amounts.
- Finally, positions in Treasury STRIPS of varying small notional amounts are also taken by the arbitrageur. 
- The net cash flows from the replicating strategy exactly match those from the Treasury bond, but at a cost of only **$146.379.**
- Thus, the cash flows from the Treasury bond can be replicated at a cost that is **\$23.10** less than that of the Treasury bond.

#### Step 2: Set-up Cash Flows of the TIPS, Inflation Swaps and STRIPS
- *Note, initially we assume that the TIPS and Treasury note have identical maturity and coupon cash flow dates. The *Time* column lists the coupon payment dates of the TIPS.
- The (real) coupon cash flows of the TIPS are $\frac{0.01875}{2}\times 100=0.9375$
- The coupon cash flows of the Treasury note are are $\frac{0.0425}{2}\times 100=2.125$
- *Notation*:
  - Let $P_{STR}(t,T)$ be the time-$t$ price of Treasury STRIPS with maturity in $T$ years. In the table below, we omit the $T$ to designate the coupon cash flow dates of the TIPS. 
  - Let $x_T$ denote the notional amount of the Treasury STRIPS.
  - Let $I_t/I_0$ denote the inflation adjustment on the TIPS at time $t$.
  - Let $P_{\textrm{Swap}}(t)$ denote the cash flow on the fixed leg of the inflation swap with notional of \$1, i.e. $$P_{\textrm{Swap}}(t)=(1+f_t)^t-1$$ 
  - The floating leg of the inflation swap has a time-$t$ cash flow of $\frac{I_t}{I_0} - 1$

- The column *Inflation Swap Rates* shows the inflation swap rates from the Bloomberg system on 10/5/2006.
  - _Note: To get inflation swap rates with tenors exactly matching the cash flow dates of the TIPS, we make two adjustments. First, we need to account for seasonalities in inflation swap rates (e.g. inflation rates for certain months during the year are higher/lower than in other months). Second, swap rates for short tenors (e.g. 1 month) are known because the reference CPI index values for near-term months are already known in the current month due to the 3-month indexaction lag). For details, see Fleckenstein, Longstaff, and Lustig (2014)._
- The column SwapTenors shows the swap tenors as a fraction of a year.
  - The cash flow dates of the inflation swaps are on the coupon cash flow dates of the TIPS.
  - For example, the first tenor as a fraction of a year is 0.2795.
    - (31-5) days in October + 30 days in November + 31 days in December + 15 days in January = 102. Thus, 102/365=0.2795. Similarly for the other cash flow dates.

- Swap Fixed Leg = \$\\left( 1 + f(T)\\right)^{T} -1\$

#### Details
- Note that the TIPS and the Treasury have slightly different maturity dates.
  - The TIPS has maturity date on July 15, 2015.
  - The Treasury note has maturity date on August 15, 2015.
- To adjust for this small difference, we take the following approach.
  - Step 1: We calculate the yield to maturity of the TIPS.
  - Step 2: We calculate the price of the Treasury note by discounting the Treasury note cash flows by the yield computed in the previous step.
- The price calculated in step 2 is the price of the TIPS that can be compared to the price of the Treasury note because it accounts for the difference in th timing of cash flows.
- The yield of the TIPS turns out to be 4.97% and the market price of the Treasury note if its yield is 4.97% turns out to be 95.4583.
- Thus the Treasury note is \$98.07337 - \$95.4583 = \$2.61507 more expensive than the equivalent TIPS and the arbitrage mispricing is 2.61507.
